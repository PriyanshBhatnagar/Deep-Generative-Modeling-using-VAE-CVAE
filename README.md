# Deep-Generative-Modeling-using-VAE-CVAE

In this project, we have built variational autoencoders and conditional variational autoencoders to generate handwritten digit images and compared their performance and computational efficiency. The motivation for solving the problem of generative modeling using VAEs and CVAEs is rooted in their potential applications across various fields.

We have performed hyper parameter tuning to achieve minimum loss in generated images and also visualized and optimized the latent space. This is how the latent space looks like for one of the datasets that we have used.
